"""
How many ways are there to fold a cube?
There are 12 edges, we have to cut some of them.
In order to be able to open the cube, we need to cut 3 adjacent edges.
We should be careful to not isolate any faces.
how many edges should I cut?


let's try to see it differently. there are 8 vertices.
each vertex connects 3 faces.

let's try another way.
one face is already on the plane.
the other faces can go up, down, left, or right to it.
but the faces are not independent.
either we put zero up and three down, or one up and two down, or two up and one down, or three up and no down.

wait a minute.
we need to find a path that can optionally branch.
we start at one face and we can branch up to three times.

cube:

1 -> 2, 3, 4, 5
2 -> 1, 3, 4, 6
3 -> 1, 2, 5, 6
4 -> 1, 2, 3, 6

we actually don't need to do that.
each face communicates with 4 other faces (all except the opposite one).
we only need to define the wrapping rules.

if two faces are adjacent, we just continue like in the 2d case.
if two faces are on a diagonal with one "missing face", the communication
is an "L" and we need to change the direction.
Specifically, we need to rotate towards the other face.
The communication will also be in the direction of the other face.
For instance, from 3 to 1, the communication occurs while going up,
the exit side is north, the entry side is west,
and we need to rotate clockwise because 1 is to the left of 3.

1. identify and label the faces.
    we'll split the matrix into a grid, then label the actual
    faces from 1 to 6, the rest from 7 to 12.

2. establish the connection rules.
    first, identify the neighbouring faces.
    for each face, try to go first up down left right;
    the connection rules are very simple.
    then, try to go diagonally one square (i.e. up then left, up then right, down then left, down then right)
    establish the connection rules.
    then, try to do the knight's jump.
    finally, try to wrap around to the other side.
    we must do it in this order.
    
the connection rule should say what happens when we overflow from one face
and we're going in a certain direction.
So the mapping should take a face and a direction.
it should specify the rule to compute the square where we land, as well as
the (optional) change in direction.
